# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand if product ratings given as part of Amazon’s paid “Vine” program differ compared to ratings given by users that are not part of the paid program. 


## Results
The reviews analyzed were all related to products that fall into Amazon’s category of “DVD”. Of these reviews only those with more than 20 votes were included. Of those reviews with more than 20 votes only the reviews that were voted as “helpful” greater than 50% of the time were kept. Results from this dataset are below:

- A total of 43 reviews were part of the Vine program and 140200 were not part of the Vine program

- The ratio of 5 star reviews given was 8 of 43 for Vine reviews and 73039 of 140200 for non-Vine reviews

- The percentage of 5 star Vine reviews given was 18.6% and the percentage of 5 star non-Vine reviews given was 52.1% 


## Summary 
For DVD reviews there is a positivity bias towards reviews that were not submitted as part of the Vine program. Reviewers that are part of the Vine program tend to be much more critical of DVDs, with only 18.6% giving 5 star reviews compared to 52.1% for people not part of the program. Additional analysis that would provide more insight into this result would be to compare ratings of specific DVD titles that Vine reviewers submitted vs. the same DVD titles for non-Vine reviewers.
